# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/dymoo/commitreview/security/advisories/new).
Do not open a public issue for an exploitable report.

## Threat model

commitreview runs inside GitHub Actions. There is no hosted service or
telemetry. It makes network requests to exactly two configured authorities:
GitHub's API and the required `base-url`.

**Credentials.** The model API key and GitHub token are registered with the
runner's secret masker immediately after they are read. The model key is sent
only to `base-url` in an `Authorization` header. There is no default or fallback
model endpoint.

**OpenRouter routing.** When `base-url` is exactly
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, every request requires an OpenRouter endpoint
with data collection denied and Zero Data Retention enabled. It also requires
support for all request parameters. If no matching endpoint is available, the
review fails rather than relaxing those constraints or falling back to another
model. Other configured endpoints receive no OpenRouter-specific routing
fields, including proxies that happen to implement an OpenRouter-compatible
interface.

**Data sent to the model.** A review can send the pull request title,
description and focused mention; changed hunks and surrounding source;
repository instruction documents from the base commit; and non-ignored
repository files selected by the read-only investigation. This is intentionally
broader than the diff.
Paths matching `ignore` are excluded from file selection, instruction discovery
and agent tools. The built-in list covers generated, vendored and build output,
not secrets; add sensitive paths explicitly.

**Untrusted input.** A pull request author controls code, file names and pull
request prose that reach the model. Prompts fence these as data, but prompt
instructions are not a security boundary. Treat findings as untrusted advice
and never automate merges from them.

**Pull request code is never executed.** The action downloads GitHub's repository
snapshot at the head commit, extracts it to a temporary directory and reads
files. It does not run, build, install or check out the pull request. Reads
reject traversal, backslashes and paths outside the snapshot; symlink targets
are resolved and checked before reading. The temporary snapshot is removed after
context collection, including on failure.

This makes `pull_request_target` safe for the recommended workflow only while
that workflow also avoids checking out or executing the pull request head.

**Agent boundary.** The model has only `list_files`, `read_file` and exact-text
`search`. Calls are bounded and respect ignores. There is no write tool, shell,
repository-code execution or agent network access. Endpoints that reject tool
calling fail rather than silently degrading.

**Posted model text.** GitHub sanitises rendered Markdown. commitreview also
neutralises user mentions and strips its reserved fingerprint markers from
model-authored prose before posting it.

**Who can spend the key.** Automatic `pull_request` and `pull_request_target`
events are not author-gated; on a public repository, any opened pull request can
cause a review. The `@commitreview` comment trigger is fixed to repository
owners, members and collaborators. There is no input that disables that gate.

**Permissions.** The action needs `contents: read` and
`pull-requests: write`. It never writes repository contents, pushes, approves or
requests changes. Reviews use the `COMMENT` event.

## Supply chain

There are no runtime dependencies and no bundled build output. `action.yml`
runs `src/index.js` directly on Node 20, so the audited source is the executed
source. Pin an immutable release when required:

```yaml
- uses: dymoo/commitreview@v2.0.1
```
